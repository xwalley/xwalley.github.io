        <h1>5 Reappropriated Arabic Words to English</h1>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Words transcend languages, and languages reshape words.
          The perception of the Arab and the culture surrounding it has been
          distorted to ellude to degragatory stereotypes and offenses. Mainly
          through the intervention of Western political prominence.
          The reshaping and appropriating of the Arabic language is a factor that perpetuates
          the discriminatory stereotypes, followed by media representations in the form
          of historical literary sources, paintings, and contemporary films.
          The Arabic words that have been stripped from its rooted origins
          have been reapporpriated through Western media to consequently convey an antagonizing perception
          of the Arab culture.

        <p>A harem is a woman's quarters in a domestic space.
          The word "ḥarīmī" is used to refer to women themselves.
          The orientalist west conceptualized North African women secluded in harems as
          lustful deviants through literary texts and erotic paintings. The forbidden and sacred
          nature of the harem manifested sexual fantasies and imaginative depictions of women in suggestive poses,
          illustrating colonial Europe's political prominence and culture in contrast to the depictions
          of the Orient. Distorted depictions of the harem, and the ḥarīmī, are concieved by European Orientalists as
          symbolic of oppression and subjected to control. The harem has been reinterpreted to reflect
          Europe's sexual fantasies of "Oriental" women through the voyeuristic nature of the male gaze in Orientalist
          paintings and literature. The definition of harem has been reappropriated to refer to a group of females associated with a male,
          and is even defined a genre of anime and manga where a male character is adored by female characters. This degragatory
          reinterpretation of the harem is concieved through the literary texts of One Thousand and One Nights, illustrating the harem as a
          single man's personal brothel where groups of women aggressively directed their sexuality and lust towards him.

    <p>A sheikh is a title designated to a cheif or leader of a family, village, or tribe.
    The title of respect is especially relevant given to those with high religious knowledge,
    destingusing an Islamic religious cleric and the leader of the religious order. In some
    Arab Gulf countries, notably Saudi Arabia, the official title is designated to prominent members of the royal family.
    By the 1920's, sheikh was coined a slang to describe an irresitable, alluring man. This was because
    of the 1921 movie <i>The Sheik</i>, a film that explores the appeal of fantastical "desert romance" between
    a European woman and an Arab "sheikh". The characteristics of an exotic, seductive, and savage man
    are perscribed to the Arab sheikh in the film, but reinforce stereotypes of savagery and eroticism through
    the reappropriated slang. This rendition of the sheikh is not nearly as relevant as it was in the 20's, but
    the archetype of a dangerous, seductive rapist affiliated to the term still applies as a stereotype against Arab men.

    <p>The "qaīrawān", or caravan, is a convoy of travelers. More acurately,
      it refers to a group of travelers, usually merchants or pilgrims on Hajj,
      journeying across the desert in North Africa and Asia.
      Though the Arabic term has been picked up and interpreted by English speaking nations,
      the recontextualization of the carvan is more affiliated with scrunity against immigration.
      This particularily applies to the discrimination against the migrant caravan traveling to the
      U.S-Mexico border, for instance. Immigration and the ditorted prejudice against the migrating caravan
      is reinterpreted to define a political contention.

  <div class="explain">
    <p>"Alchemy" is just Arabic for "Chemistry." More specifically,
      alchemy is the science that incorporates chemical properties based on the transformation of matter, particularily the conversion of base metals.
      Alchemy used to be framed as an occult practice. The practice of Arabic alchemy dates as back as the Greek Hellenistic period,
      where Egyptian chemists at the period experimented and looked to convert metals and lead to gold. The transmission of this knowledge through
      both the Eastern and Western hemipsheres defined the region's developed sceince and research. By the 16th century Renassiance period,
      practioners in the Western hemisphere adopted the term "chemistry" and replacing the term "alchemy", interpreting it as a word relating to a mythical and philosopical concept
      of transformation, rendering the Arabic word to affiliate with occult practices and psuedoscience.<br>
      What defined the term  "Alchemy" to be scrutized as an occult practice is the expansion of the Islamic empire, amplifying the political and cultural antagonisms
      between the Christian dominate Western hemipshere and the growing Islamic ideologies. Another factor is the methods in which Western chemistry was practiced,
      incorporating englightened Christan ideals into the development of research, skeptical of the science practiced in the Arabian peninsula.<br>

<div class="col-12">
  <div class="explain">
    <p>The word "Genie" is coined for the French translation of the Arabic
    term "Jinn"-a supernatural entity belived in pre-Islamic Arabian era and in Islamic mythology and folklore.
    The term was adopted from the French translation of Arabian Nights, which features the folk tale
    Aladdin. The story of <i>Aladdin</i>, or <i>Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp</i>, is not based on the original text, <i>The Book of One Thousand and One Nights</i>.
    Instead, it was written by Frenchman Antoine Galland, and later adapted into Western media,
    most notably the animated Disney film. During the 17th century, Orientalists including Galland percieved Arabs and
    Middle Eastern culture as fantastical, coinciding with the contrast: a secured enlightment of European arts and literature.
    Galland's rendition of the tale is based on pseudo-translations of compiled Arab folklore, including one told by Syrian storyteller, Hanna Diyab.
    The magical phenomenons of the Jinn appearing from a lamp conveys the fantastical splendors of the Middle East- an exciting depiction marveled by Europe
    during the 17th century, but has lingering skepticisms against Arab culture in the present day.
